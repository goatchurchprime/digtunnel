Survex data at: http://cave-registry.org.uk/svn/NorthernEngland/ThreeCountiesArea/survexdata/Ireby/

After installing Survex, run using:
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Survex\aven.exe" Ireby\Ireby2\Ireby2.svx

Then we can run (after editing it with the files we need to read and write)
python convertdmptojson.py
